=head1 NAME

SBOM::CycloneDX::CryptoProperties::RelatedCryptoMaterialProperties - Related Cryptographic Material Properties

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    SBOM::CycloneDX::CryptoProperties::RelatedCryptoMaterialProperties->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::CryptoProperties::RelatedCryptoMaterialProperties> specifies
properties for cryptographic assets of asset type: "related-crypto-material".

=head2 METHODS

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::CryptoProperties::RelatedCryptoMaterialProperties> inherits all methods from L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item SBOM::CycloneDX::CryptoProperties::RelatedCryptoMaterialProperties->new( %PARAMS )

Properties:

=over

=item C<activation_date>, The date and time (timestamp) when the related
cryptographic material was activated.

=item C<algorithm_ref>, The bom-ref to the algorithm used to generate the
related cryptographic material.

=item C<creation_date>, The date and time (timestamp) when the related
cryptographic material was created.

=item C<expiration_date>, The date and time (timestamp) when the related
cryptographic material expires.

=item C<format>, The format of the related cryptographic material (e.g. P8,
PEM, DER).

=item C<id>, The optional unique identifier for the related cryptographic
material.

=item C<secured_by>, The mechanism by which the cryptographic asset is
secured by.

=item C<size>, The size of the cryptographic asset (in bits).

=item C<state>, The key state as defined by NIST SP 800-57.

=item C<type>, The type for the related cryptographic material

=item C<update_date>, The date and time (timestamp) when the related
cryptographic material was updated.

=item C<value>, The associated value of the cryptographic material.
