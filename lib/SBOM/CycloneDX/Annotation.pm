=head1 NAME

SBOM::CycloneDX::Annotation - Annotations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    SBOM::CycloneDX::Annotation->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

A comment, note, explanation, or similar textual content which provides
additional context to the object(s) being annotated.

=head2 METHODS

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Annotation> inherits all methods from L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item SBOM::CycloneDX::Annotation->new( %PARAMS )

Properties:

=over

=item C<annotator>, The organization, person, component, or service which
created the textual content of the annotation.

=item C<bom_ref>, An optional identifier which can be used to reference the
annotation elsewhere in the BOM. Every bom-ref must be unique within the
BOM.
Value SHOULD not start with the BOM-Link intro 'urn:cdx:' to avoid
conflicts with BOM-Links.

=item C<signature>, Enveloped signature in JSON Signature Format (JSF)
(L<https://cyberphone.github.io/doc/security/jsf.html>).

=item C<subjects>, The object in the BOM identified by its bom-ref. This is
often a component or service, but may be any object type supporting
bom-refs.

=item C<text>, The textual content of the annotation.

=item C<timestamp>, The date and time (timestamp) when the annotation was
created.
