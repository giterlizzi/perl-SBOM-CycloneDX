=head1 NAME

SBOM::CycloneDX::Standard::Requirement - Requirement

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    SBOM::CycloneDX::Standard::Requirement->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Standard::Requirement> provides the requirement comprising the standard.

=head2 METHODS

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Standard::Requirement> inherits all methods from L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item SBOM::CycloneDX::Standard::Requirement->new( %PARAMS )

Properties:

=over

=item C<bom_ref>, An optional identifier which can be used to reference the
object elsewhere in the BOM. Every bom-ref must be unique within the BOM.

=item C<descriptions>, The supplemental text that provides additional
guidance or context to the requirement, but is not directly part of the
requirement.

=item C<external_references>, External references provide a way to document
systems, sites, and information that may be relevant, but are not included
with the BOM. They may also establish specific relationships within or
external to the BOM.

=item C<identifier>, The unique identifier used in the standard to identify
a specific requirement. This should match what is in the standard and
should not be the requirements bom-ref.

=item C<open_cre>, The Common Requirements Enumeration (CRE) identifier(s).
CRE is a structured and standardized framework for uniting security
standards and guidelines. CRE links each section of a resource to a shared
topic identifier (a Common Requirement). Through this shared topic link,
all resources map to each other. Use of CRE promotes clear and unambiguous
communication among stakeholders.

=item C<parent>, The optional `bom-ref` to a parent requirement. This
establishes a hierarchy of requirements. Top-level requirements must not
define a parent. Only child requirements should define parents.

=item C<properties>, Provides the ability to document properties in a
name-value store. This provides flexibility to include data not officially
supported in the standard without having to use additional namespaces or
create extensions. Unlike key-value stores, properties support duplicate
names, each potentially having different values. Property names of interest
to the general public are encouraged to be registered in the [CycloneDX
Property
Taxonomy](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-property-taxonomy). Formal
registration is optional.

=item C<text>, The textual content of the requirement.

=item C<title>, The title of the requirement.
