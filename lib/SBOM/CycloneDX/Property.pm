=head1 NAME

SBOM::CycloneDX::Property - Provides the ability to document properties in a
name-value store

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $bom->properties->add(
        SBOM::CycloneDX::Property->new( name => 'Foo', value => 'Bar' )
    );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Manufacture> provides the ability to document properties in a
name-value store. This provides flexibility to include data not officially
supported in the standard without having to use additional namespaces or create
extensions. Unlike key-value stores, properties support duplicate names, each
potentially having different values. Property names of interest to the general
public are encouraged to be registered in the CycloneDX Property Taxonomy
(L<https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-property-taxonomy>).

Formal registration is optional. Each item of this array must be a Lightweight
name-value pair object.

=head2 METHODS

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Property> inherits all methods from L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item SBOM::CycloneDX::Property->new( %PARAMS )

Properties:

=over

=item * C<name>, The name of the property. Duplicate names are allowed, each
potentially having a different value.

=item * C<value>, The value of the property.

=back

=item $property->value
