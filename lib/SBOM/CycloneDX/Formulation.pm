=head1 NAME

SBOM::CycloneDX::Formulation - Formula

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    SBOM::CycloneDX::Formulation->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Formulation> describes workflows and resources that
captures rules and other aspects of how the associated BOM component or
service was formed.

=head2 METHODS

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Formulation> inherits all methods from L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item SBOM::CycloneDX::Formulation->new( %PARAMS )

Properties:

=over

=item C<bom_ref>, An optional identifier which can be used to reference the
formula elsewhere in the BOM. Every bom-ref must be unique within the BOM.
Value SHOULD not start with the BOM-Link intro 'urn:cdx:' to avoid
conflicts with BOM-Links.

=item C<components>, Transient components that are used in tasks that
constitute one or more of this formula's workflows

=item C<properties>, Provides the ability to document properties in a
name-value store. This provides flexibility to include data not officially
supported in the standard without having to use additional namespaces or
create extensions. Unlike key-value stores, properties support duplicate
names, each potentially having different values. Property names of interest
to the general public are encouraged to be registered in the CycloneDX
Property Taxonomy (L<https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-property-taxonomy>).
Formal registration is optional.

=item C<services>, Transient services that are used in tasks that
constitute one or more of this formula's workflows

=item C<workflows>, List of workflows that can be declared to accomplish
specific orchestrated goals and independently triggered.
