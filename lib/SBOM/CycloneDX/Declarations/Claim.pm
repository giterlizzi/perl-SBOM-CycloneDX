=head1 NAME

SBOM::CycloneDX::Declarations::Claim - Claim

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    SBOM::CycloneDX::Declarations::Claim->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Declarations::Claim> provides the claim object.

=head2 METHODS

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Declarations::Claim> inherits all methods from L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item SBOM::CycloneDX::Declarations::Claim->new( %PARAMS )

Properties:

=over

=item C<bom_ref>, An optional identifier which can be used to reference the
object elsewhere in the BOM. Every bom-ref must be unique within the BOM.

=item C<counter_evidence>, The list of `bom-ref` to counterEvidence that
supports this claim.

=item C<evidence>, The list of `bom-ref` to evidence that supports this
claim.

=item C<external_references>, External references provide a way to document
systems, sites, and information that may be relevant but are not included
with the BOM. They may also establish specific relationships within or
external to the BOM.

=item C<mitigation_strategies>, The list of  `bom-ref` to the evidence
provided describing the mitigation strategies. Each mitigation strategy
should include an explanation of how any weaknesses in the evidence will be
mitigated.

=item C<predicate>, The specific statement or assertion about the target.

=item C<reasoning>, The written explanation of why the evidence provided
substantiates the claim.

=item C<signature>, Enveloped signature in JSON Signature Format (JSF)
(L<https://cyberphone.github.io/doc/security/jsf.html>).

=item C<target>, The `bom-ref` to a target representing a specific system,
application, API, module, team, person, process, business unit, company,
etc...  that this claim is being applied to.
