=head1 NAME

SBOM::CycloneDX::Vulnerability::ProofOfConcept - Proof of Concept

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    SBOM::CycloneDX::Vulnerability::ProofOfConcept->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Vulnerability::ProofOfConcept> Evidence used to
reproduce the vulnerability.

=head2 METHODS

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Vulnerability::ProofOfConcept> inherits all methods from L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item SBOM::CycloneDX::Vulnerability::ProofOfConcept->new( %PARAMS )

Properties:

=over

=item C<environment>, A description of the environment in which
reproduction was possible.

=item C<reproduction_steps>, Precise steps to reproduce the vulnerability.

=item C<supporting_material>, Supporting material that helps in reproducing
or understanding how reproduction is possible. This may include
screenshots, payloads, and PoC exploit code.
