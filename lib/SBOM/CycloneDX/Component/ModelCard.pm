=head1 NAME

SBOM::CycloneDX::Component::ModelCard - Model Card

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    SBOM::CycloneDX::Component::ModelCard->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Component::ModelCard> provides a model card describes the
intended uses of a machine learning model and potential limitations,
including biases and ethical considerations. Model cards typically contain
the training parameters, which datasets were used to train the model,
performance metrics, and other relevant data useful for ML transparency.
This object SHOULD be specified for any component of type
`machine-learning-model` and must not be specified for other component
types.

=head2 METHODS

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Component::ModelCard> inherits all methods from L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item SBOM::CycloneDX::Component::ModelCard->new( %PARAMS )

Properties:

=over

=item C<bom_ref>, An optional identifier which can be used to reference the
model card elsewhere in the BOM. Every bom-ref must be unique within the
BOM.
Value SHOULD not start with the BOM-Link intro 'urn:cdx:' to avoid
conflicts with BOM-Links.

=item C<considerations>, What considerations should be taken into account
regarding the model's construction, training, and application?

=item C<model_parameters>, Hyper-parameters for construction of the model.

=item C<properties>, Provides the ability to document properties in a
name-value store. This provides flexibility to include data not officially
supported in the standard without having to use additional namespaces or
create extensions. Unlike key-value stores, properties support duplicate
names, each potentially having different values. Property names of interest
to the general public are encouraged to be registered in the CycloneDX
Property Taxonomy (L<https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-property-taxonomy>).
Formal registration is optional.

=item C<quantitative_analysis>, A quantitative analysis of the model
