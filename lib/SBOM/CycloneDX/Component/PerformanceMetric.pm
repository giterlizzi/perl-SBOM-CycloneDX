=head1 NAME

SBOM::CycloneDX::Component::PerformanceMetric - Performance Metric

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    SBOM::CycloneDX::Component::PerformanceMetric->new();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Component::PerformanceMetric> provides the model performance
metrics being reported. Examples may include accuracy, F1 score, precision,
top-3 error rates, MSC, etc.

=head2 METHODS

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Component::PerformanceMetric> inherits all methods from L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item SBOM::CycloneDX::Component::PerformanceMetric->new( %PARAMS )

Properties:

=over

=item C<confidence_interval>, The confidence interval of the metric.

=item C<slice>, The name of the slice this metric was computed on. By
default, assume this metric is not sliced.

=item C<type>, The type of performance metric.

=item C<value>, The value of the performance metric.

=back

=item $performance_metric->confidence_interval

=item $performance_metric->slice

=item $performance_metric->type

=item $performance_metric->value
