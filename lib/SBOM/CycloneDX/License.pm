=head1 NAME

SBOM::CycloneDX::License - Specifies the details and attributes related to a software license

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # SPDX license

    $license = SBOM::CycloneDX::License->new(
        id => 'Apache-2.0'
    );

    # or

    $license = SBOM::CycloneDX::License->new('MIT');


    # Non-SPDX license

    $license = SBOM::CycloneDX::License->new(
        name => 'Acme Software License'
    );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::License> specifies the details and attributes related to a software
license.

It can either include a valid SPDX license identifier or a named license,
along with additional properties such as license acknowledgment, comprehensive
commercial licensing information, and the full text of the license.

=head2 METHODS

L<SBOM::CycloneDX::License> inherits all methods from L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Base>
and implements the following new ones.

=over

=item SBOM::CycloneDX::License->new( $id | %PARAMS )

Properties:

=over

=item * C<bom_ref>, An optional identifier which can be used to reference the license
elsewhere in the BOM. Every bom-ref must be unique within the BOM.

Value SHOULD not start with the BOM-Link intro C<urn:cdx:> to avoid conflicts with BOM-Links.

=item * C<id>, A valid SPDX license identifier. If specified, this value must be
one of the enumeration of valid SPDX license identifiers defined in L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Enum> C<SPDX_LICENSES>.

=item * C<expression>, A tuple of exactly one SPDX License Expression.

Refer to L<https://spdx.org/specifications> for syntax requirements.

=item * C<name>, The name of the license. This may include the name of a commercial
or proprietary license or an open source license that may not be defined by SPDX.

=item * C<acknowledgement>, 

=item * C<text>, An optional way to include the textual content of a license.
See L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Attachment>

=item * C<url>, The URL to the license file. If C<1> is provided, the license URL is
automatically generated.

=item * C<licensing>, Declared licenses and concluded licenses represent two different
stages in the licensing process within software development. Declared licenses refer
to the initial intention of the software authors regarding the licensing terms
under which their code is released. On the other hand, concluded licenses are the
result of a comprehensive analysis of the project's codebase to identify and confirm
the actual licenses of the components used, which may differ from the initially
declared licenses. While declared licenses provide an upfront indication of the
licensing intentions, concluded licenses offer a more thorough understanding of
the actual licensing within a project, facilitating proper compliance and risk
management. Observed licenses are defined in C<$bom->evidence->licenses>. Observed
licenses form the evidence necessary to substantiate a concluded license.

See L<SBOM::CycloneDX::License::Licensing>


=item * C<properties>, Provides the ability to document properties in a name-value
store. This provides flexibility to include data not officially supported in the
standard without having to use additional namespaces or create extensions.
Unlike key-value stores, properties support duplicate names, each potentially
having different values. Property names of interest to the general public are
encouraged to be registered in the CycloneDX Property Taxonomy. Formal
registration is optional. See L<SBOM::CycloneDX::Property>
